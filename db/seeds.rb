      text: "A question that might come to mind when 
      analyzing trap music is whether the lyrical content is in fact an
      accurate representation of the rapper's selves and their views. 
      With this question in mind, what can one make of Future?
      
      As his life fell apart in recent years, his music has 
      receded further and further away
      
      from human decency, with fugue-like beats and gruesome
      lyrics depicting himself as drugged out, violent, almost criminal.
      But as his music tumbled deeper into the abyss,
      the acclaim and success he found skyrocketed
      
      Future's character is both enthralling and disturbing:
      The content of his drawling verses will shock you—if you manage to pay attention.
      He is the super-villain incumbent of trap: Dark, brooding, and dangerous. ",

      Yeah, okay
      Lil CC on the beat, mmm
      Yeah, yeah
      
      I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
      I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
      I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
      Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
      Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
      I got two phones, one need a charge
      Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
      I got big packs comin' on the way
      I got big stacks comin' out the safe
      I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
      It's a big gap between us in the game
      In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
      When I die, put my money in the grave
      
      When I die, put my money in the grave
      I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
      Really just lapped every nigga in the race
      I really might tat 'Realest Nigga' on my face
      Lil CC let it slap with the bass
      I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
      Now I'm like, 'Nah, love, I'm good, go away'
      Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it",
